# NodeJS AI Workshop application
This is a simple web application we will be using in this workshop to try out different AI services.

In order to get this application to run, you need to have NodeJS installed. 

To get started, simply open up a console and run the following command:
```
npm run dev
```

The first time you run this command it may take some time, as all node modules will be downloaded before the web server can start.
